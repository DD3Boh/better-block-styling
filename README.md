# Better block styling plugin for SiYuan

Welcome to the **Better block styling** plugin for SiYuan!

This plugin is designed to simplify the process of styling blocks and creating cards, by providing various pre-made styles that can be applied to your paragraphs to create cards.

It also provides pre-made stylings for blocks like superblocks and embedded blocks, which can improve their appearance in some contexts.

## Features

- **Theme your paragraphs**: Use pre-made cards templates to theme your paragraph blocks.
- **Theme your blocks**: Bring a slicker theming to superblocks, embedded blocks and more.

## Usage

You can use the plugin from the paragraph menu, like shown in the showcase GIF below.
